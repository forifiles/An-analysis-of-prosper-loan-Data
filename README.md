# An Analysis of Prosper Loan Data
## by Fori Joseph Tatama


## Dataset

I investigated a dataset called Prosper Loan Data that contained information on 113,937 loan entries spanning 2009 to 2014 with 81 attributes on each loan. The attributes included demographic information on the borrowers such as their annual income, wether or not they are homeowners and their employment status. We also have information the Borrower APR & Rates, the status of the loans, and the Ratings on the Loan.  


## Summary of Findings

From our explorations we were able to notice the following major points.

* Most loans were taken in multiples of USD5K, and most of the loans were taken by the employed.
* A persons financial standing greatly affects the rates that they get on their loans. We see this from the effect that the prosper rating has on Borrower APR and the effect that being a homeowner has on Borrower Rate. This is also further seen on the relationship between stated monthly income and prosper rating.
* The greatest motivation for taking a loan seems to be for luxury purchases, items such as boats, weddings, motorcycles, home improvement, vacations and engagement rings are very promininent reasons for taking loans. Other than those, Business and Debt consolidation seem to be the more pragmatic reasons for taking a loan.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For this presentation, I'll focus on the relationship between Borrower Rate and a few key eatures.

I have used a heat map, a line chart and a point plot.
